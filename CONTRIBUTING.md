## Code of Conduct

By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to <vikasprabhu@credenceanalytics.com>.

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/Credence-Analytics/metabase-cli/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

-   Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Credence-Analytics/metabase-cli/issues/new).
-   Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
-   Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.

Depending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:
- IRC
- Slack
- Gitter
- Stack Overflow tag
- Blog
- FAQ
- Roadmap
- E-Mail List
- Forum
-->

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-   Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/Credence-Analytics/metabase-cli/blob/main/README.md). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
-   To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [issues](https://github.com/Credence-Analytics/metabase-cli/issues).
-   Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
-   Collect information about the bug:
    -   Stack trace (Traceback)
    -   OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
    -   Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
    -   Possibly your input and the output
    -   Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <vikasprabhu@credenceanalytics.com>.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

-   Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Credence-Analytics/metabase-cli/issues). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
-   Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
-   Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
-   Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

-   The project team will label the issue accordingly.
-   A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
-   If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Metabase CLI, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-   Read the [documentation](https://github.com/Credence-Analytics/metabase-cli/blob/main/README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
-   Perform a [search](https://github.com/Credence-Analytics/metabase-cli/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
-   Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Credence-Analytics/metabase-cli/issues).

-   Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
-   Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
-   **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
-   You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
-   **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Metabase CLI users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

## Getting Started

### Fork The repository

-   First fork our repository into your own Github account, and create a local clone of it as described in the installation instructions.
-   The latter will be used to get new features implemented or bugs fixed.
-   Once done and you have the code locally on the disk, you can get started.
-   We advice to not work directly on the master branch, but to create a separate branch for each issue you are working on. That way you can easily switch between different work, and you can update each one for latest changes on upstream master individually.

### Create a pull request

-   When you think the code is ready for review a pull request should be created on Github.
-   Owners of the repository will watch out for new PR‘s and review them in regular intervals. By default for each change in the PR we run all the tests. If tests are failing make sure to address the failures immediately.
-   Otherwise you can wait for a review. If comments have been given in a review, they have to get integrated. For those changes a separate commit should be created and pushed to your remote development branch.
-   Don’t forget to add a comment in the PR afterward, so everyone gets notified by Github. Keep in mind that reviews can span multiple cycles until the owners are happy with the new code.
